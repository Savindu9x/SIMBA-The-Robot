# SIMBA-The-Robot
Autonomous Robot Competition @ Monash University Malaysia

ECE3091, Third Year Engineering Design Unit focused on designing an autonomous mobile Robot that can sense, act and plan out sequence of actions which picks different colors of disks with a custom-made robot gripper and carry them into a designated area where it flicks the disks into correct color zone after identifying the right color within a given time period. Robot was based on PSoC 5LP SoC  along with different sensors including ultrasonic, IR, Color sensing, IMU, shaft encoder and servo motors & DC motors with gearboxes are served as actuators.
